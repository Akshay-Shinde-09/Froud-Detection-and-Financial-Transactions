Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions – Data Science Project
📌 Overview

This project focuses on building machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraud detection is a critical task due to the massive imbalance between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The project covers the full data science workflow—data loading, cleaning, EDA, modelling, and evaluation using industry-standard metrics.

📂 Dataset

Total transactions: 284,807

Fraudulent transactions: 492 (0.17%)

Legitimate transactions: 284,315

Contains anonymized features V1–V28 generated by PCA, plus:

Time – seconds from first transaction

Amount – transaction value

Class – target variable (1 = Fraud, 0 = Legitimate)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-learn (ML modelling & metrics)

Jupyter Notebook

Machine Learning Algorithms
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree

🔍 Steps Performed
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset using Pandas.

Checked structure, duplicates, outliers, and class distribution.

2. Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates.

Treated outliers using IQR-based filtering.

Ensured correct data types and cleaned skewed variables.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Studied distribution of transaction amounts (right skewed).

Compared fraud vs. non-fraud amounts.

Visualized correlations among PCA components (very low correlation).

Scatter plots for understanding patterns between Time and Amount.

Analyzed descriptive statistics for both fraud and legitimate classes.

4. Modeling

Built and compared two models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Data split: 80% training, 20% testing

5. Evaluation

Metrics used:

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

ROC-AUC

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy

Model Performance Summary:

Model	Accuracy	Fraud Recall	Fraud Precision	ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	99.90%	49%	82%	0.9630
Decision Tree	99.92%	75%	77%	0.8748

Decision Tree performed slightly better overall in detecting fraudulent cases.

📈 Results

Class imbalance made recall a crucial metric.

Decision Tree achieved the best result with 99.92% accuracy and improved fraud recall (75%).

Logistic Regression also performed well but showed lower recall for fraud cases.

ROC-AUC scores indicate strong model performance for both algorithms.
